            <h3>MODULE 6 - Digital Identity and Personal Footprint</h3>
        </div>
        
        <div class="topic-content">
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Reflect on the consequences of our online actions and learn how to manage our digital identity to maintain a secure and professional image on the web. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>The Concept of Digital Identity and How It Is Constructed</h4>
                <p>Imagine your <strong>digital identity</strong> as your ‚Äúself‚Äù in the online world. It is everything that defines you on the internet: your social media profiles, your photos and videos, the comments you make, the forums you participate in, your blog posts or video games, and even what others post about you. </p>

<p>Every time you upload a photo, write a comment, ‚Äúlike‚Äù something, or create a profile in a game, you are building this identity. It's like leaving little pieces of a puzzle that, when put together, form a picture of who you are online. And the interesting thing is that this picture may be different from who you are in real life, or very similar!</p>
                
                <p><strong>How is it built?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What you post:</strong> Photos, videos, texts, your opinions.
<li><strong>What others post about you:</strong> Photos in which you are tagged, comments from friends or family.
<li><strong>Your interactions:</strong> Who you follow, what pages you like, what groups you join.
                    <li><strong>Data that is automatically generated:</strong> Your location (if you have it enabled), the searches you do, the websites you visit. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>All of this creates your digital profile, which is not static; it evolves with you, but once something is on the internet, it can be very difficult to completely delete. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>Digital Footprint: what it is, how it is formed, and its long-term implications</h4>
                <p>Your digital footprint is the unique trail of data you leave behind every time you use the internet. Think of it as the footprints you leave when walking on sand, but in this case, in the digital world. And they are much harder to erase!</p>
                
                <p><strong>What is it and how is it formed?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active Footprint:</strong> This is the one you leave on purpose. For example, when you post a photo on Instagram, write a tweet, send an email, or fill out an online form. You are the one who decides to share that information.
<li><strong>Passive footprint:</strong> This is the one that is generated without you directly realizing it. It happens when you visit a website (your IP address and browser are saved), when apps use your location in the background, or when websites use cookies to track your behavior and show you ads. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Long-term implications:</strong></p>
                <p>Your digital footprint matters not only now, but also in the future.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Future opportunities:</strong> Universities, scholarship programs, and future employers review candidates' social media accounts. A negative digital footprint (inappropriate photos, offensive comments, history of harassment) can close doors for you.
                    <li><strong>Personal reputation:</strong> What you post can be seen by your family, friends, teachers, and people you don't even know, affecting how they perceive you. </li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy and security:</strong> Exposed personal information can be used for identity theft, harassment, or even to trick you into future scams. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>Online reputation: impact on personal and professional life</h4>
                <p>Your online reputation is, simply put, how others perceive you based on your digital identity. It is the opinion they form of you based on what they see on the internet. It is not what you think you are posting, but what others interpret from your posts and your online behavior. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact on personal and professional life:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal life:</strong> If your friends or family see posts they don't like or that put you at risk, it can lead to conflict or mistrust. Cyberbullying can also seriously affect your emotional well-being and relationships.
Academic life: More and more universities are reviewing applicants' social media accounts. A bad online reputation can negatively influence your admission or even your chances of obtaining scholarships.
<li><strong>Professional life:</strong> Employers use social media to research candidates. They look for consistency between what you say on your resume and your online behavior. Inappropriate comments, photos of wild parties, or a sloppy image can get you kicked out of the selection process. On the other hand, a positive reputation that shows off your talents, interests, and respectful behavior can open a lot of doors!
                </ul>

            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>Managing your digital footprint: what to look for, what to delete, what to control</h4>
                <p>Managing your digital footprint is like cleaning your room: sometimes you have to tidy up, throw away what you don't need, and make sure everything is in its place. </p>
                
                <p><strong>What to look for?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your name in search engines:</strong> Open an incognito window in your browser and search for your full name. Repeat with variations (e.g., ‚Äúyour name‚Äù + ‚Äúyour city,‚Äù ‚Äúyour name‚Äù + ‚Äúyour school‚Äù). Check both text and images and videos.
<li><strong>Your social media:</strong> Do you have profiles you created years ago and forgot about? Are there old photos you've been tagged in that no longer represent you?</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentions:</strong> Use tools like Google Alerts to notify you if your name appears in new publications. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What to delete?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inappropriate or compromising content:</strong> Photos of excessive partying, offensive comments, bad jokes, complaints about work or school.
                    <li><strong>Sensitive personal information:</strong> Your exact address, personal phone number (unless for a specific purpose), details about your daily routines (e.g., ‚ÄúI go to the gym at this time every day‚Äù).</li>
                    <li><strong>Old and forgotten profiles:</strong> If you don't use them, deactivate or delete them. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What to check?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy settings:</strong> Regularly review and adjust the privacy settings on all your social media accounts and apps. Decide who can see your posts, who can tag you, who can search for you. Make it private until you decide otherwise!</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong passwords and 2FA:</strong> Protect your accounts.
                    <li><strong>Think before you post:</strong> Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWould I want my future boss/teacher to see this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWould I feel comfortable if this appeared in the news?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs this something I want to remain on the internet forever?‚Äù. If the answer is ‚Äúno,‚Äù don't post it!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>The right to be forgotten and how to exercise it</h4>
                <p>The right to be forgotten is a concept that allows you, under certain circumstances, to request search engines (such as Google) to remove links to information about you that is obsolete, irrelevant, or violates your privacy. It is important to understand that this does not mean that the information disappears from the internet, but rather that search engines do not display it in their results when someone searches for your name. </p>
                
                <p><strong>How to exercise it?</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the content:</strong> First, find the information you want to stop appearing in search engines. </li>
                    <li><strong>Contact the original website:</strong> If possible, the first step is always to contact the administrator of the website where the information is published to request its direct removal. If they delete it, the search engine will stop indexing it.
<li><strong>Request to the search engine:</strong> If the original website does not delete it or you cannot contact them, you can send a formal request to the search engine (Google has a specific form for this). You must justify why that information should be disassociated from your name.
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This right has limitations. It does not apply to information of public interest or content that is relevant and accurate. It is a process that can be complex and does not guarantee the total removal of information from the internet, only from search results associated with your name. </p>

                <h4>Tips for building a positive and secure digital identity</h4>
                <p>Building a positive digital identity is not just about avoiding the bad, but also showing the good. </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Be Authentic and Positive:</strong> Share your interests, talents, achievements, and passions in a way that represents you positively. Be respectful and constructive in your interactions.
                    <li><strong>Think Before You Post (The ‚ÄúGrandma Rule‚Äù):</strong> Before uploading something, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWould I feel comfortable if my grandmother (or anyone important to me) saw this? What about my future self, 5 or 10 years from now?‚Äù If the answer is no, don't post it!</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect Your Privacy:</strong> Constantly review and adjust your social media privacy settings. Limit who can see your posts, photos, and personal information.
<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Protect your accounts to prevent identity theft.
                    <li><strong>Be Aware of Who Follows You and Who You Follow:</strong> Make sure the people you interact with online are trustworthy and don't put you at risk.
<li><strong>Be Critical of Information:</strong> Don't believe everything you see and read on the internet. Verify your sources.
Disable inactive accounts: If you no longer use a social network or platform, disable or delete your account.
Search for your name regularly: Perform periodic searches to see what information appears about you so you can manage it.
                    <li><strong>Contribute Positively:</strong> Share useful content, participate in causes that interest you, or showcase your skills on relevant platforms.
                </ol>

            <div class="activity-box">
                <h4>Suggested Activities:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exposure Calculator:</strong> Use the ‚ÄúMy Digital Footprint‚Äù tool on the website.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> This interactive activity, if available on your website, will guide young people through a series of questions about their online habits and the information they share. At the end, it will give them an ‚Äúexposure score‚Äù or a summary of how visible their information is, along with personalized tips for improvement.
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To raise awareness in a practical way about the amount of information that is exposed.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Search:</strong> Have participants search for their own name in a search engine to see what results come up and reflect on their digital footprint.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Ask young people to search for their full name on Google or other search engines, ideally in incognito mode (to avoid personalized results based on their browsing history). They can also search for variations or their nickname, and check the images section.
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To confront them directly with their current digital footprint and allow them to see what information is available about them. This can be a starting point for identifying content they may want to manage or delete. </li>
                            <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> After the search, encourage a guided discussion:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>‚ÄúWhat did you find that surprised you?‚Äù</li>
                                    <li>‚ÄúDid you find anything you wouldn't want a future employer or college to see?‚Äù</li>
                                    <li>‚ÄúWhat steps could you take to improve what you found?‚Äù</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
